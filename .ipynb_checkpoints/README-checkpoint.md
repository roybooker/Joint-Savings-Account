# Joint-Savings-Account

## At a startup that I was tasked with building a new and disruptive platform called Fintech Finder. Fintech Finder is an application that its customers can use to find fintech professionals from among a list of candidates, hire them, and pay them. As Fintech Finder’s lead developer, I have been tasked with integrating the Ethereum blockchain network into the application in order to enable customers to instantly pay the fintech professionals whom they hire with cryptocurrency.
The following code enables customers to send cryptocurrency payments to fintech professionals.

## Observations
A fintech startup company has recently hired you. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.
To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I've create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. This smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
